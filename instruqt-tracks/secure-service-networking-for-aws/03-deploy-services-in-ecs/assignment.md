The assignment the participant needs to complete in order to proceed.

You can use any GitHub flavoured markdown.

We're going to use the `terraform.tfvars` generated earlier. You can review the `terraform.tfvars` file in the `conde - HCP Config` tab.

Copy the `terraform.tfvars` file to the ECS deployment directory with the following command:

```sh
cp /root/config/terraform.tfvars .
```

Verify with
```sh
terraform plan
```

Deploy with:
```sh
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
