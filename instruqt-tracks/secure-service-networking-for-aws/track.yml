teaser: Implement 'Secure by Default' Service Networking for AWS platforms.
description: Securing micro-services is extremely complex. Traditional security technologies
  operate at the platform edge, and not at the inter-service communications behind
  them. There is a solution, and in this workshop you will implement Secure Service
  Networking across and within multiple AWS platforms using the HachiCorp Cloud Platform
  (HCP).
